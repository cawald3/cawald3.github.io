I'm a full-time microelectronics engineer in the Electro-Optical Systems Lab at the [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu/). I'm also a graduate student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the [Space System Design Lab](https://ssdl.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. My research interests include wireless communications, digital systems, and electronics design for harsh environments, primarily focused on space applications. I'm also passionate about teaching and finding new ways to teach complex topics within engineering in an engaging and approachable manner.

I graduated from Georgia Tech with my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in December, 2021. I started working at the Georgia Tech Research Institute in January, 2022. I decided to pursue my graduate degree while working and graduated with my Master's degree in electrical and computer engineering in August, 2024. I'm originally from Hendersonville, NC. In my freetime, I enjoy photography, playing piano, and amateur astronomy.
