There's an upcoming mission in the Space System Design Lab at Georgia Tech called VISORS, which stands for Virtual Super-Resolution Optics Using Reconfigurable Swarms. VISORS consists of two cubesats that fly in close proximity to eachother to image the sun's corona. Operations will happen out of Georgia Tech using our ground stations.

I work on our ground stations at Tech, but in the past couple of years, we haven't had to support many missions. Lunar Flashlight was our last big mission, and that used the Deep Space Network to provide communication. VISORS is one of the first missions we've had in a while that will rely heavily on our ground stations.

However, VISORS is launching into a near polar orbit. This means that in Atlanta, GA, we would only get two ~15 minute passes each day at best -- not nearly enough to support the data downlink we need from the mission. So we're collaborating with several universities to increase our ground station coverage. The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks allowed us to stick an antenna on their existing masthead up at the Poker Flats test range. Due to its geographic location, this ground station should have the VISORS satellites in its view multiple times a day. I went up in early June to get our ground station equipment set up and wanted to write a bit about the process in this post. 

## Hardware

We have several different ground stations at Georgia Tech and they all have slightly different hardware which makes maintaining them cumbersome. For VISORS, I wanted to develop a set of hardware that would be easily deployable to other locations and give good performance. VISORS also gave me a good excuse to do this anyway, as it's using the 401 MHz band versus the amateur band that many satellites use for their UHF communications. Supporting the 401 MHz band meant revamping a lot of the equipment at our ground stations.

Here's a breakdown of the major components that make up our stations:
- Ettus B210 Radio
- Empower RF 1094 20 - 520 MHz 100 Watt Amplifier
- M2 Antenna Systems 402CP43 yagi antenna
- Yaesu Rotator
- Mini-circuits ZKL-33-ULNS+ Low Noise Amplifier
- Custom RF Relay Board
- Custom TX/RX sequencer Board

Our system is half-duplex so I had to find a way to sequence the TX/RX switching. I did this using a custom board that would take in inputs from the B210 and control the biasing of some custom relay boards. This board also controls the amplifier power, monitors input power levels to protect the amplifier, and provides some basic health telemetry over the arduino's serial port.

RF relays can be expensive, especially for higher power options. There's some good test data here by an amateur radio operator, where they measured the performance of cheaper relay options. I designed a board around the HF3 relay. While only listed as handling 50 watts, I tested these relay boards up to 120 watts of power at 400 MHz. They got warm, but nothing outside of their operating range given in the datasheet. I'm assuming that the 50 watt number given in the data sheet corresponds to the worst case insertion loss at XXX Ghz, which corresponds to the relay dissipating XXX watts internally. The insertion loss at 400 MHz is much lower, only XXX dB, meaning it would internally dissipate the limit XXX watts at an input power of XXXX watts. I didn't test up to this but it might be worth while.

I ran out of time to design a rack mountable enclosure for all of the elements that needed to sit inside the shack near the computer. I ended up going with the next best option: glueing everything together. I needed the system to be compact so I just mounted as many components to the amplifier + heatsink assembly as I could. We had some expired 2216 epoxy lying around lab that I used -- it wasn't acceptable for use on cubesats anymore but it could hold some relay boards to the amplifiers just fine. I ended up creating this wonderful assembly:



## In Alaska
Whenever I got to Alaska, it was far enough in the summer season that it never got completely dark.

We spent the first day getting everything mounted in place. LASP has just installed a new tower mast and we had to do new cable runs between the control shack and antenna masthead. The location at Poker Flats where we installed the antenna is on the top of a hill with no obstructions around, providing excellent horizon to horizon coverage.

After installation, we needed to do our first series of checks to make sure that everything was working properly. Luckily, due to the location of Poker Flats, we typically had a high elevation pass of a satellite transmitting in the 401 MHz range.
