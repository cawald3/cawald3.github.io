After spending 6 years at Georgia Tech as a student and full-time employee, I decided it was time to make a change. I accepted a position in Group 64 at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, which is their advanced satellite communications systems and operations group. They do some really cutting edge work that is right up my alley, so I'm excited to have the opportunity.
