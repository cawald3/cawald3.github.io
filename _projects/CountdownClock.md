My parents requested something physical that would show them the time remaining until their retirement, so I decided to make them a countdown clock. I could have gone with something simple that just used seven segment displays, but I wanted something that looked better, gave me more flexibility, and allowed me to hide some easter eggs in the design. This is still a work in progress so I'll update the page once I get the project finished.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="/assets/img/clockproject/ClockCoverImage.jpg" title="Aurora Research Building" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
